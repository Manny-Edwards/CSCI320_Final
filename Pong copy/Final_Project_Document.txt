Goals
Use Javaspaces to write a distributed application that simulates a multiplayer pong game.

Pong game
This project’s goal is to create a game of pong that two players maximum can play from different devices that support the
software. I used Javaspaces because as the multiplayer aspect is similar to our older energy_mplay project, I felt that
javaspaces was the most fitting technique for this. A distributed application makes the most sense since it would not make
sense for two players to be crammed on one keyboard to play together especially if their keyboard only recognizes one key
at a time. Having it be distributed makes for a better experience.

Operation
In order to use this application, the host(user), must first run the GameStart class which creates the space for the two
players. Only one GameStart is necessary and you will not be able to proceed without it running. You will be prompted with
two windows asking for a height and width for the game’s panel. The objects within the game will scale with the size of
the window.
Each player must then, from their own devices, run the Player_Create class, which creates a player and puts them into the
space. Once the space has two players, the game will begin. All other players then attempting to join after the game has
started will be met with a message and their process will terminate.
As of now, the game goes until a player misses 21 times.

Both players utilize the up and down arrow keys to move their paddle.
